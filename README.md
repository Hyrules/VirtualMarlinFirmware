A virtual marlin firmware for testing serial connections.

This is a virtual version of marlin. It will answer to some basic commands :
You will need to connect it to some COM Port devices like BigTreeTech TFT screens

instead of always having to upload to a real 3D printer.

M503
M92
M115
M114
M220
